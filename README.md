# Drip_chip_API

Our company "Drip-Chip” is engaged in chipping animals in the country “Wonderland” to track their movement and life cycles. The movement of animals around the planet is extremely important, including to protect them from death.

This year, our company decided to create a single database into which records of past years will be transferred to conduct long-term experiments related to animal migrations, as well as to track changes in habitats and maintain history.
